Added materials, allowing for more blocks

Pre-alpha 0.1.0 12w405:
Added camera concept

Pre-alpha 0.1.1 12w406:
Working camera
Changed from orothogrphic to perspective

Pre-alpha 0.1.2 12w407:
Physics added.
Buggy FPS controller (SINE was inverted) added.
Look-around added.

Pre-alpha 0.1.3 12w40a:
Basic collision detection added and fixed.
FPS controller fixed.
Basic world generation added.

Pre-alpha 0.2.0 12w40f:
Rewrote entire materials, block renderer and world engine to support the new Material type.
Dirt, stone and voidrock classes removed.
Respawning was added.
Camera view was changed to 2 blocks height.

Pre-alpha 0.2.1 12w40g:
Enabled basic occulsional culling by only rendering blocks beside transparent materials.
Implemented block place and break events
Added block breaking

Pre-alpha 0.2.2 12w40h:
Changed default chunks-per-world to 4 (2x2)
Repositioned logic in BlockRenderEngine, making it only process the OpenGL only if it is seen, 
as opposed to last time when OpenGL was processed first. FPS increased by x2. YAAAAAY!!! xD
Physics now uses fixed updating.
Fixed a bug in which colliders don't disappear when blocks are broken.
First public release.

Pre-alpha 0.2.2 12w40i:
Fixed a bug in which blocks don't render correctly at the edge of the map.
Changed map height to 200.
Added more performance optimisations
Drank some coffee
Added noise to dirt levels 48 and above
Tested:
 - 3x3 chunks (9 chunks in memory). Laggy as hell.
 - Turning off physics (No effect)
 - Adding a whole lot of noise. Lots of blocks on screen and laggy as hell.
 Conclusion: Rendering is what causes lag. Not the physics/stage.
Wish me luck for EOY!

Pre-alpha 0.2.2 12w40j:
I won't be doing much development today, exams tomorrow.
Repositioned logic so that air won't be calculated for culling. Argh.
Changed map height to 256.
Implemented face culling so that only visible faces will be rendered.
Changed it such that blocks only calculate culling when it is updated.
Implemented loading by chunk-basis, allowing for dynamic generation and chunk culling.
*IN PROGRESS* Adding chunk culling (only load the chunk when it is in view)
Changed it such that the chunk only calculates locality during generation.
Rewrote rendering engine to chunk-block basis instead of stage-actor basis for blocks.
Rewrote collision engine ^
Changed collision engine to collide only with same chunk! AWWW YEAAAH
Changed block engine to id-based. Update block now managed by a whole, saving memory.
